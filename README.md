# Grocery Tracker

A simple raw web app for planning, budgeting, and tracking groceries, built with plain HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS via CDN for a beautiful modern UI.

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. No installation required—it runs directly in the browser using localStorage for data persistence.

## Features (MVP)

- **Budget Setup**: Enter your monthly grocery budget and currency.
- **Add Grocery Items**: Input name, unit price, and frequency (e.g., every 3 days). The app calculates times needed per month and total monthly cost.
- **Purchase Tracker**: Tick off purchases for each item and track progress.
- **Monthly Summary**: View total planned spend, total spent, remaining budget, and progress per item.

Data is saved in your browser's localStorage. To reset, clear your browser storage or add a reset button in future updates.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS (CDN for styling)

This is the simplest raw form— we can expand it step by step.
